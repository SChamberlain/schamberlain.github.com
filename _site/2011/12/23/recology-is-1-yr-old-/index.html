<p>This blog has lasted a whole year already. &nbsp;Thanks for reading and commenting. </p>

<h3 id="there-are-a-couple-of-announcements">There are a couple of announcements:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Less blogging: I hope to put in many more years blogging here, but in full disclosure <a href="http://jecologyblog.wordpress.com/">I am blogging for Journal of Ecology</a> now, so I am going to be (and already have been) blogging less here.</li>
  <li>More blogging: If anyone wants to write guest posts at Recology on the topics of using R for ecology and evolution, or open science, please contact me. </li>
  <li>Different blogging: I was going to roll out the new dynamic views for this blog, but Google doesn&rsquo;t allow javascript, which is how I include code using GitHub gists. Oh well&hellip;</li>
</ol>

<p>Anywho, here is the breakdown of visits to this blog, visualized using #ggplot2, of course. There were a total of about 23,000 pageviews in the first year of this blog. </p>

<p>Here is the pie chart code I used:
