    As ecologists, we often start graduate school worshiping the ivory tower of academia with its freedom to pursue important ecological questions. However, studies have shown that most of us do not end up in academia. Greater numbers of ecology graduates are leaving the ivory tower for non-academic career paths. But for many graduates, moving from an academic environment to a non-academic job may be difficult. In graduate school we are trained to work in a particular way, often with loose deadlines and unlimited intellectual freedom (within reason of course). The culture and expectations of the non-academic world may be quite different. What are the skills that you need in a government job, or in science journalism? How do you market yourself for a non-academic position? This is a timely topic because funding to academic ecologists is being cut, leaving fewer opportunities in the academic arena. In fact, an ESA Student Section survey found that an ESA 2013 session on non-academic career paths in ecology was the topic of greatest interest.

[Sandra Chung][sandra] and I organized an ESA lunchtime session on Tuesday the 6th with panelists from an array of non-academic careers to offer advice and share their experiences. Each panelist will speak briefly, introducing themselves and a bit about what they do. About half of the time will be reserved for an open discussion in which you all attending the session help decide what to talk about.

You can find the description of the session at the ESA site [here][ses]. 

**The details:**

+ When: Tuesday, August 6, 2013: 11:30 AM-1:15 PM
+ Where: 101B, Minneapolis Convention Center
+ Who (the panelists): 
	+ [Virginia Gewin][virginia]: Independent science journalist (w/ work in Science/Nature/etc.)
	+ [Liz Neeley][liz]: Science communication/journalism at COMPASS (a non-profit org.)
	+ [Joe Simonis][joe]: Research scientist at the Lincon Park Zoo (a non-profit org.)
	+ [Ted Hart][ted]: Soon to be statistician at NEON
	+ [Lael Goodman][lael]: Analyst w/ the Union of Concerned Scientists

**Get involved**

      <a href="/2013/07/code/">
        On writing, sharing, collaborating, and hosting code for science
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2013</span>

    I recently engaged with a number of tweeps in response to my tweet:

> Rule number 1 wrt science code: DO NOT post your code on your personal website

That tweet wasn't super clear, and it's difficult to convey my thoughts in a tweet. What I should have said was do post your code - ideally on Github/Bitbucket/etc. Here goes with a much longer version to explain what I meant. The tweet was just about where to host code, whereas the following is about more than that, but related.

### Code writing during analyses, etc.

When you write code to do simulations, analyses, data manipulation, visualization - whatever it is - it helps to version your code. That is, not naming files like *myfile_v1.r*, *myfile_v2.r*, etc., but with versioning using version control systems (VCS) like [git][git], [svn][svn], [mercurial][mc], etc. Although git will give you headaches during the learning process, it takes care of versioning your code for you, finding differences in different versions, helps you manage conflicts from different contributors, and allows you to restore that old code you accidentally deleted. 

And you don't have to use git or svn on a code hosting site - you can use git or svn locally on your own machine. However, there are many benefits to putting your code up on the interwebs. 

### Collaborating on code

Whenever you collaborate on code writing you have the extreme joy of dealing with conflicts. Perhaps you use Dropbox for collaborating on some code writing. Crap, now there is a line of code that messes up the analysis, and you don't know who put it there, and why it's there. Wouldn't it be nice to have a place to collect bugs in the code. 

All of these things become easy if you host code on a service such as Github. If you are already versioning your code with git you are in luck - all you need to do is create an account on github/bitbucket and push your code up. If not, you should definitley learn git.

Hosting your code on Github (or Bitbucket, etc.) allows each collaborator to work separately on the code simultaneously, then merge their code together, while git helps you take care of merging. An awesome feature of git (and other VCS's) is branching. What the heck is that? Basically, you can create a complete copy of your git project, do any changes you want, then throw it away or merge it back in to your main branch. Pretty sweet. 

### Sharing your code
 
Whether sharing your code with a collaborator, or with the world, if you put code on a website created specifically for hosting code, I would argue your life would be easier. Groups like Github and Bitbucket have solved a lot of problems around versioning code, displaying it, etc., whereas your website (whether it be Google sites, Wordpress, Tumblr, etc.) can not say the same. 

It is becoming clear to many that open science has many benefits. For the sake of transparency and contributing to the public science good, I would argue that sharing your code is the right thing to do, especially given that most of us are publicly funded. However, even if you don't want to share your code publicly, you can get free private hosting with an [academic discount on Github](https://github.com/edu), and Bitbucket gives you private hosting for free.

### Contributing to the software you use

Much of the software you and I use in R, Python, etc. is likely hosted on a code hosting platform such as Github, Bitbucket, R-Forge, etc. Code gets better faster if its users report bugs and request features to the software authors. By creating an account on Github, for example, to host your own code, you can easily report bugs or request features where others are developing software you use. This is better than email as only those two people get the benefit of learning from the conversation - while engaging where the software is created, or on a related mailing list, helps everyone. 

### On long-term availability of code

Where is the best place to host your code in the long-term. Some may trust their own website over a company - a company can go out of business, be sold to another company and then be shut down, etc. However, code on personal websites can also be lost if a person moves institutions, etc. If you use a VCS, and host your code on Bitbucket/Github/Etc., even if they shut down, you will always have the same code that was up on their site, and you can host it on the newer awesome code hosting site. In addition, even if a company shuts down and you have to move your code, you are getting all the benefits as stated above.

### Anyway...

My point is this: do post your code somewhere, even if on your own site, but I think you'll find that you and others can get the most out of your code if you host it on Bitbucket, Github, etc. Do tell me if you think I'm wrong and why.

    <h1>
      <a href="/2013/06/geojson/">
        R to GeoJSON
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2013</span>

    **UPDATE** As you can see in Patrick's comment below you can convert to GeoJSON format files with rgdal as an alternative to calling the Ogre web API described below. See [here](https://github.com/patperu/write2geojson/blob/master/write-geojson.R) for example code for converting to GeoJSON with rgdal.

***************

GitHub recently introduced the ability to render [GeoJSON][geojson] files on their site as maps [here][post1], and recently introduced [here][post2] support for [TopoJSON][topojson], an extension of GeoJSON can be up to 80% smaller than GeoJSON, support for other file extensions (`.topojson` and `.json`), and you can embed the maps on other sites (so awesome). The underlying maps used on GitHub are [Openstreet Maps][openstreet]. 

A recent blog post showed how to convert .shp or .kml files to GeoJSON to then upload to GitHub [here][ruby]. The approach used Ruby on the command line locally to convert the geospatial files to GeoJSON. 

Can we do this in R? Perhaps others have already done this, but there's more than one way to do anything, no? 

I'm not aware of a converter to GeoJSON within R, but there is a web service that can do this, called [Ogre][ogre]. The service lets you `POST` a file, which then converts to GeoJSON and gives it back to you. Ogre accepts many different file formats: BNA, CSV, DGN, DXF, zipped shapefiles, GeoConcept, GeoJSON, GeoRSS, GML, GMT, KML, MapInfo, and VRT. 

We can use the Ogre API to upload a local geospatial file of various formats and get the GeoJSON back, then put it up on GitHub, and they render the map for you. Sweetness. 

So here's the protocol. 

***************

### 1. Load httr. What is httr? For those not in the know it is a simpler wrapper around RCurl, a curl interface for R.


{% highlight r %}
# install.packages('httr')
library(httr)
{% endhighlight %}

### 2. Here is a function to convert your geospatial files to GeoJSON (with roxygen docs).


{% highlight r %}
togeojson <- function(file, writepath = "~") {
    url <- "http://ogre.adc4gis.com/convert"
    tt <- POST(url, body = list(upload = upload_file(file)))
    out <- content(tt, as = "text")
    fileConn <- file(writepath)
    writeLines(out, fileConn)
    close(fileConn)
}
{% endhighlight %}

### 3. Convert a file to GeoJSON

**KML**

In the first line I specify the location of the file on my machine. In the second line the function `togeojson` reads in the file, sends the file to the API endpoint *http://ogre.adc4gis.com/convert*, collects the returned GeoJSON object, and saves the GeoJSON to a file that you specify. Here we are converting a KML file with point occurrences (data collected from [USGS's BISON service](http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/)). 


{% highlight r %}
file <- "~/github/sac/rgeojson/acer_spicatum.kml"
togeojson(file, "~/github/sac/rgeojson/acer_spicatum.geojson")
{% endhighlight %}


**Shapefiles**

Here, we are converting a zip file containing shape files for *Pinus contorta* (data collected from the USGS [here](http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/little/). 


{% highlight r %}
file <- "~/github/sac/rgeojson/pinucont.zip"
togeojson(file, "~/github/sac/rgeojson/pinus.geojson")
{% endhighlight %}


### 4. Then commit and push to GitHub. And this is what they look like on GitHub

*Acer spicatum* distribution (points)

<!-- ![](/public/img/acer_spiacdtum_dist.png) -->
<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/sckott/rgeojson/output/acer_spicatum.geojson"></script>

*Pinus contorta* distribution (polygons)

<!-- ![](/public/img/pinus_dist.png) -->
<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/sckott/rgeojson/output/pinus.geojson"></script>

***************

If you want, you can clone a repo from my account. Then do the below. (of course, you must have git installed, and have a GitHub account...)

First, fork my `rgeojson` repo [here](https://github.com/sckott/rgeojson) to your GitHub account.

Second, in your terminal/command line...

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/rgeojson.git
cd rgeojson
{% endhighlight %}

Third, in R specify the location of either the KML file or the zipped shape files, then call `togeojson` function to convert the KML file to a GeoJSON file (which should output a file *acer_spicatum.geojson*)


{% highlight r %}
file <- "/path/to/acer_spicatum.kml"
togeojson(file, "~/path/to/write/to/acer_spicatum.geojson")
{% endhighlight %}


Fourth, back in the terminal...

{% highlight bash %}
git add acer_spicatum.geojson
git commit -a -m 'some cool commit message'
git push
{% endhighlight %}

Fifth, go to your *rgeojson* repo on GitHub and click on the *acer_spicatum.geojson* file, and the map should render.

***************

Look for this functionality to come to the [rbison][rbison] and [rgbif][rgbif] R packages soon. Why is that cool?  Think of the workflow: Query for species occurrence data in the BISON or GBIF databases, convert the results to a GeoJSON file, push to GitHub, and you have an awesome interactive map on the web. Not too bad eh.
