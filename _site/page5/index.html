    <p>I'm doing a presentation today to grad students on R resources. I have been writing HTML presentations recently, but some great tools are now available to convert text that is easy to read and write to presentations.</p>

<ul>
<li>RStudio has something called <code>R presentations</code>, that is basically Markdown. This tool is built in to RStudio. See some docs <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/presentations/overview">here</a>. A cool feature of RStudio's presentations is that the preview of the presentation live updates on each save - nice <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i></li>
<li>Another option is the slidify package, made by <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv">Ramnath Vaidyanathan</a>. The canonical url for slidify is <a href="http://slidify.org/">here</a>. Slidify gives you more options and flexibity than RStudio presentations.</li>
</ul>


<p>For this presentation I went with RStudio's product. See the Markdown file for the presentation <a href="https://github.com/sckott/posterstalks/blob/gh-pages/sfu/resources/r_resources.Rpres">here</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the presentation slides here, and if you want, fork it on Github, change it, submit changes back to me, etc. (click to go to slides)</p>

        Beyond academia

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2013</span>

    <p>As ecologists, we often start graduate school worshiping the ivory tower of academia with its freedom to pursue important ecological questions. However, studies have shown that most of us do not end up in academia. Greater numbers of ecology graduates are leaving the ivory tower for non-academic career paths. But for many graduates, moving from an academic environment to a non-academic job may be difficult. In graduate school we are trained to work in a particular way, often with loose deadlines and unlimited intellectual freedom (within reason of course). The culture and expectations of the non-academic world may be quite different. What are the skills that you need in a government job, or in science journalism? How do you market yourself for a non-academic position? This is a timely topic because funding to academic ecologists is being cut, leaving fewer opportunities in the academic arena. In fact, an ESA Student Section survey found that an ESA 2013 session on non-academic career paths in ecology was the topic of greatest interest.</p>

<p><a href="http://sandrachung.com/">Sandra Chung</a> and I organized an ESA lunchtime session on Tuesday the 6th with panelists from an array of non-academic careers to offer advice and share their experiences. Each panelist will speak briefly, introducing themselves and a bit about what they do. About half of the time will be reserved for an open discussion in which you all attending the session help decide what to talk about.</p>

<p>You can find the description of the session at the ESA site <a href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2013/webprogram/Session9083.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The details:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When: Tuesday, August 6, 2013: 11:30 AM-1:15 PM</li>
<li>Where: 101B, Minneapolis Convention Center</li>
<li>Who (the panelists):

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.virginiagewin.com/">Virginia Gewin</a>: Independent science journalist (w/ work in Science/Nature/etc.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.compassonline.org/staff/LizNeeley">Liz Neeley</a>: Science communication/journalism at COMPASS (a non-profit org.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lpzoo.org/conservation-science/resources/staff-bios/joseph-l-simonis-phd">Joe Simonis</a>: Research scientist at the Lincon Park Zoo (a non-profit org.)</li>

      <a href="/2013/07/code/">
        On writing, sharing, collaborating, and hosting code for science
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2013</span>

    <p>I recently engaged with a number of tweeps in response to my tweet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rule number 1 wrt science code: DO NOT post your code on your personal website</p></blockquote>

<p>That tweet wasn't super clear, and it's difficult to convey my thoughts in a tweet. What I should have said was do post your code - ideally on Github/Bitbucket/etc. Here goes with a much longer version to explain what I meant. The tweet was just about where to host code, whereas the following is about more than that, but related.</p>

<h3>Code writing during analyses, etc.</h3>

<p>When you write code to do simulations, analyses, data manipulation, visualization - whatever it is - it helps to version your code. That is, not naming files like <em>myfile_v1.r</em>, <em>myfile_v2.r</em>, etc., but with versioning using version control systems (VCS) like <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">svn</a>, <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/">mercurial</a>, etc. Although git will give you headaches during the learning process, it takes care of versioning your code for you, finding differences in different versions, helps you manage conflicts from different contributors, and allows you to restore that old code you accidentally deleted.</p>

<p>And you don't have to use git or svn on a code hosting site - you can use git or svn locally on your own machine. However, there are many benefits to putting your code up on the interwebs.</p>

<h3>Collaborating on code</h3>

<p>Whenever you collaborate on code writing you have the extreme joy of dealing with conflicts. Perhaps you use Dropbox for collaborating on some code writing. Crap, now there is a line of code that messes up the analysis, and you don't know who put it there, and why it's there. Wouldn't it be nice to have a place to collect bugs in the code.</p>

<p>All of these things become easy if you host code on a service such as Github. If you are already versioning your code with git you are in luck - all you need to do is create an account on github/bitbucket and push your code up. If not, you should definitley learn git.</p>

<p>Hosting your code on Github (or Bitbucket, etc.) allows each collaborator to work separately on the code simultaneously, then merge their code together, while git helps you take care of merging. An awesome feature of git (and other VCS's) is branching. What the heck is that? Basically, you can create a complete copy of your git project, do any changes you want, then throw it away or merge it back in to your main branch. Pretty sweet.</p>

<h3>Sharing your code</h3>

<p>Whether sharing your code with a collaborator, or with the world, if you put code on a website created specifically for hosting code, I would argue your life would be easier. Groups like Github and Bitbucket have solved a lot of problems around versioning code, displaying it, etc., whereas your website (whether it be Google sites, Wordpress, Tumblr, etc.) can not say the same.</p>

<p>It is becoming clear to many that open science has many benefits. For the sake of transparency and contributing to the public science good, I would argue that sharing your code is the right thing to do, especially given that most of us are publicly funded. However, even if you don't want to share your code publicly, you can get free private hosting with an <a href="https://github.com/edu">academic discount on Github</a>, and Bitbucket gives you private hosting for free.</p>

<h3>Contributing to the software you use</h3>

<p>Much of the software you and I use in R, Python, etc. is likely hosted on a code hosting platform such as Github, Bitbucket, R-Forge, etc. Code gets better faster if its users report bugs and request features to the software authors. By creating an account on Github, for example, to host your own code, you can easily report bugs or request features where others are developing software you use. This is better than email as only those two people get the benefit of learning from the conversation - while engaging where the software is created, or on a related mailing list, helps everyone.</p>

<h3>On long-term availability of code</h3>

<p>Where is the best place to host your code in the long-term. Some may trust their own website over a company - a company can go out of business, be sold to another company and then be shut down, etc. However, code on personal websites can also be lost if a person moves institutions, etc. If you use a VCS, and host your code on Bitbucket/Github/Etc., even if they shut down, you will always have the same code that was up on their site, and you can host it on the newer awesome code hosting site. In addition, even if a company shuts down and you have to move your code, you are getting all the benefits as stated above.</p>

<h3>Anyway...</h3>

<p>My point is this: do post your code somewhere, even if on your own site, but I think you'll find that you and others can get the most out of your code if you host it on Bitbucket, Github, etc. Do tell me if you think I'm wrong and why.</p>
