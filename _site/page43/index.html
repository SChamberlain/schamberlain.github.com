    <p>Interesting talks/posters:<div><br />Richard Lankau presented research on trade-offs and competitive ability. He suggests that during range expansion selection for increased intraspecific competitive ability in older populations leads to loss of traits for interspecific competitive traits due to trade-offs between these traits. <br /><br /><br />Ellner emphatically states that rapid evolution DOES matter for ecological responses, and longer-term evolutionary patterns as well. [His paper on the talk he was giving came out prior to his talk, which he pointed out, good form sir]<br /><br /><br />Lauren Sullivan gave an interesting talk on bottom up and top down effects on plant reproduction in one site of a huge network of sites doing similar nutrient and herbivory manipulations around the globe - NutNet (go here: <a href="http://nutnet.science.oregonstate.edu/">http://nutnet.science.oregonstate.edu/</a>). <br /><br /><br />Laura Prugh shows in California that the engineering effects (i.e., the mounds that they make) of giant kangaroo rats are more important for the associated food web than the species interaction effects (the proxy used was just density of rats). <br /><br /><br />Kristy Deiner suggests that chironomids are more phylogenetic similar in lakes with stocked fish relative to fishless lakes, in high elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada. She used barcode data to generate her phylogeny of chironomids. If you have barcode data and want to search BOLD Systems site, one option is doing it from R using rbold, a package under development at <a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> (code at <a href="https://github.com/sckott/rbold">Github</a>). <br /><br /><br />Jessica Gurevitch presented a large working group&#39;s methods/approach to a set of reviews on invasion biology. We didn&#39;t get to see a lot of results from this work, but I personally was glad to see her explaining to a packed room the utility of meta-analysis, and comparing to the medical field in which meta-analysis is sort of the gold standard by which to draw conclusions. <br /><br /><br />Following Jessica, Jason Fridley told us about the Evolutionary Imbalance Hypothesis (EIH) (see my notes <a href="http://schamber.wordpress.com/lab-notebook-2/">here</a>). He posed the problem of, when two biotas come together, what determines which species are retained in this new community and which species are left out. He listed a litany of traits/responses to measure to get at this problem, but suggested that with a little bit of &quot;desktop ecology&quot;, we could simply ask: Is the invasability of X region related to the phylogenetic diversity of that region? In three destination regions (Eastern Deciduous Forests, Mediterranean California, and the Czech Republic) out of four there was a positive relationship between proportion of invasive plant species in a source region and the phylogenetic diversity of the source regions. <ul></ul></div></p>

    <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Interesting talks/posters:</span><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></div><div><ul><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Ethan White&#39;s poster describing <a href="http://ecologicaldata.org/">EcologicalData.org</a> was of course awesome given my interest in getting data into the hands of ecologists over at <a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci.org</a>. Ethan also has software you can download on your machine to get the datasets you want easily - <a href="http://ecologicaldata.org/ecodata-retriever">EcoData Retriever</a>. [rOpenSci will try to take advantage of their work and allow you to call the retriever from R]</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Carl Boettiger&#39;s talk was awesome. He explained how we need better tools to be able to predict collapses using early warning signals. He developed a way to estimate the statistical distribution of probabilities of system collapse.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Jennifer Dunne: Explained how she put together an ancient network from Germany. Bravo.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Carlos Melian explained his model of network buildup that starts from individuals, allows speciation, and other evolutionary processes.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white;">Rachel Winfree told us that in two sets of mutualistic plant-pollinator networks in New Jersey and California, that the least connected pollinator species were the most likely to be lost from the network with increasing agricultural intensity.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white;">Dan Cariveau suggests that pollination crop services can be stabilized even with increasing agriculture intensity if in fact pollinator species respond in different ways. That is, some pollinators may decrease in abundance with increasing ag intensity, while other species may increase - retaining overall pollination services to crops.</span></span></li>

        Monday at #ESA11

    <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2011</span>

    <p>Monday was a good day at ESA in Austin.&nbsp;There were a few topics I promised to report on in my blogging/tweeting.<br /><br /><br />...focused on open source data. <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~strasser/Site/Home.html">Carly Strasser&#39;s</a> presentation on guidelines for data management was awesome (including other talks in the symposium on Creating Effective Data Management Plans for Ecological Research). Although this was a good session, I can&#39;t&nbsp;help but wish that they had hammered home the need for open science more. Oh well. Also, they talked&nbsp;a lot about how, and not a lot of why we should properly curate data. Still, a good session. One issue Carly and I talked about was tracking code in versioning systems such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a culture of versioning code for analyses/simulations in ecology. But when we get there...it will be easier to share/track/collaborate on &nbsp;code.<br /><br />...used R software. <a href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2011/preliminaryprogram/abstract_31982.htm">David Jennings</a>&nbsp;talked about a meta-analysis asking if phylogenetic distance influences competition strength in pairwise experiments. David used the metafor package in R to do his meta-analysis. Good form sir.<br /><br />...did cool science. <a href="http://www.ecologicalevolution.org/people/former-lab-members/matthew-helmus/">Matt Helmus </a>presented a great talk on phylogenetic species area curves (likely using R, or Matlab maybe?).<br /><br /><br />p.s. <a href="http://ropensci.org/developers/">We</a> launched <a href="http://ropensci.org/2011/07/welcome-to-ropensci/">rOpenSci</a> today.<br /><br /><br />Oddities:<br /><ul><li>The Tilman effect - Tilman&#39;s talk was so packed it looked like there was a line waiting to get into a trendy bar. <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~ashander/images/til.jpg">Here&#39;s a picture</a>&nbsp;(credit: Jaime Ashander). Bigger room next time anyone?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Wiley came out with an open source journal called <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2045-7758">Ecology and Evolution</a>. This brings them to 3 open source journals (the other two are in other fields). We (<a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a>) will attempt to hand-shake with these journals.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The vegetarian lunch option was surprisingly good. Nice.&nbsp;</li>
