    ## ScienceOnline Climate

I recently attended ScienceOnline Climate, a conference in Washington, D.C. at AAAS offices. You may have heard of the ScienceOnline annual meeting in North Carolina - this was one of their topical meetings focused on Climate Change. Another one is coming up in October, ScienceOnline Oceans. Search Twitter for \#scioClimate (or the entire list of hashtags [here][tags]) for tweets from the conference.

One of the sessions I attended was focused on how to democratize climate change knowledge, moderated by a fellow from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Search Twitter for \#sciodemocracy to see the conversation from that session. There was a lot of very interesting discussion.

## Can we reach the public with phenology data?

During the \#sciodemocracy session, I had a thought but couldn't articulate it at the time. So here goes. People that are not inolved in climate change discussions may not think about climate change in the framework of changing sea level, melting ice, and altered severity of extreme events. However, many people observe birds, butterflies, and trees outside their apartment windows, cars/trains/buses, or on walks or hikes. When you live in a one place for many years changes in the timing of when birds, butterflies, and trees do certain things are easily noticed. Many of us, including myself, don't necessarily record these changes, but some do! In fact, there are many web sites with databases of observations of birds, butterflies, and more that anyone, not just scientists, can submit observations to. Some examples are the [USA National Phenology Network][usnpn] and [iNaturalist][inat]. And of course there are other databases that are focused on observations of organisms collected by scientists, like [GBIF][gbif] and [VertNet][vertnet]. 

So what? What about it?

When enough of these observations are collected on any one species in one location (e.g., let's say we have 1000 observations of a species in Seattle over 20 years) we can simply ask how has the first date of record of the species in Seattle changed through time? If there is a change in timing of first appearance in the spring through the years, we can hypothesize that this may be due to climate change, and look at the data to see if there is a correlation, etc. 

Non-scientists along with scientists are collecting vast amounts of data on observations of species. This data can be used to make people think about climate change. That is, why don't we not only facilitate the public's ability to collect data, but also to analyze the data - to do their own science, ask their own questions. In this way, people can link a bird appearing for the first time in spring a bit later than the previous year, or a tree flowering a bit early, to variables associated with climate change, like temperature, precipitation, etc. 

Empowering the general public to do their own science may bring the vague notion of climate change into stark relief - thereby movivating some to take action with their elected representatives, or to at least get curious to find out more.

        Working with climate data from the web in R
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Aug 2013</span>

    I recently attended [ScienceOnline Climate][sciocweb], a conference in Washington, D.C. at AAAS. You may have heard of the [ScienceOnline annual meeting in North Carolina][sciox] - this was one of their topical meetings focused on Climate Change. I moderated a session on [working with data from the web in R][sciordata], focusing on climate data. Search Twitter for \#scioClimate for tweets from the conference, and \#sciordata for tweets from the session I ran. The following is an abbreviated demo of what I did in the workshop showing some of what you can do with climate data in R using our packages.

Before digging in, why would you want to get climate data programatically vs. via pushing buttons in a browser? Learning a programming language can take some time - we all already know how to use browsers. So why?!  First, getting data programatically, especially in R (or Python), allows you to then easily do other stuff, like manipulate data, visualize, and analyze data. Second, if you do your work programatically, **you** and *others* can reproduce, and extend, the work you did with little extra effort. Third, programatically getting data makes tasks that are repetitive and slow, fast and easy - you can't easily automate button clicks in a browser. Fourth, you can combine code with writing to make your entire workflow reproducible, whether it's notes, a blog post, or even a research article.

## Interactive visualizations in R

Let's start off with something shiny. The majority of time I make static visualizations, which are great for me to look at during analyses, and for publications of research findings in PDFs. However, static visualizations don't take advantage of the interactive nature of the web. Ramnath Vaidyanathan has developed an R package, [rCharts][rcharts], to generate dynamic Javascript visualizations directly from R that can be used interactively in a browser. Here is an example visualizing a dataset that comes with R. 


{% highlight r %}
library(devtools)
install_github("rCharts", "ramnathv")
library(rCharts)

# Load a data set
hair_eye_male <- subset(as.data.frame(HairEyeColor), Sex == "Male")

# Make a javascript plot object
n1 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Hair, group = "Eye", data = hair_eye_male, type = "multiBarChart")

# Visualize
n1$show(cdn = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}


Check out the output [here][rchartsout]. If you like you can take the source code from the visualization (right click on select *View Page Source*) and put it in your html files, and you're good to go (as long as you have dependencies, etc.) - quicker than learning [d3][d3] and company from scratch, eh. This is a super simple example, but you can imagine the possibilities.  


## The data itself


### First, install some packages - these are all just on Github, so you need to have devtools installed


{% highlight r %}
library(devtools)
install_github("govdat", "sckott")
install_github("rnoaa", "ropensci")
install_github("rWBclimate", "ropensci")
install_github("rnpn", "ropensci")
{% endhighlight %}



### Politicians talk - Sunlight Foundation listens

#### Look at mentions of the phrase "climate change" in congress, using the govdat package


{% highlight r %}
library(govdat)
library(ggplot2)

# Get mentions of climate change from Democrats
dat_d <- sll_cw_timeseries(phrase = "climate change", party = "D")

# Add a column that says this is data from deomcrats
dat_d$party <- rep("D", nrow(dat_d))

# Get mentions of climate change from Democrats
dat_r <- sll_cw_timeseries(phrase = "climate change", party = "R")

# Add a column that says this is data from republicans
dat_r$party <- rep("R", nrow(dat_r))

# Put two tables together
dat_both <- rbind(dat_d, dat_r)

# Plot data
ggplot(dat_both, aes(day, count, colour = party)) + theme_grey(base_size = 20) + 
    geom_line() + scale_colour_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))
{% endhighlight %}

### NOAA climate data, using the rnoaa package

#### Map sea ice for 12 years, for April only, for the North pole


{% highlight r %}
library(rnoaa)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(doMC)
library(plyr)

# Get URLs for data
urls <- seaiceeurls(mo = "Apr", pole = "N")[1:12]

# Download sea ice data
registerDoMC(cores = 4)
out <- llply(urls, noaa_seaice, storepath = "~/seaicedata", .parallel = TRUE)

# Name elements of list
names(out) <- seq(1979, 1990, 1)

# Make a data.frame
df <- ldply(out)

# Plot data
ggplot(df, aes(long, lat, group = group)) + geom_polygon(fill = "steelblue") + 
    theme_ice() + facet_wrap(~.id)
{% endhighlight %}

![center](/public/img/2013-08-17-sciordata/seaice2.png) 



### World Bank climate data, using the rWBclimate package

#### Plotting annual data for different countries

Data can be extracted from countries or basins submitted as vectors. Here we will plot the expected temperature anomaly for each 20 year period over a baseline control period of 1961-2000. These countries chosen span the north to south pole. It's clear from the plot that the northern most countries (US and Canada) have the biggest anomaly, and Belize, the most equatorial country, has the smallest anomaly.


{% highlight r %}
library(rWBclimate)

# Search for data
country.list <- c("CAN", "USA", "MEX", "BLZ", "ARG")
country.dat <- get_model_temp(country.list, "annualanom", 2010, 2100)

# Subset data to one specific model
country.dat.bcc <- country.dat[country.dat$gcm == "bccr_bcm2_0", ]

# Exclude A2 scenario
country.dat.bcc <- subset(country.dat.bcc, country.dat.bcc$scenario != "a2")

# Plot data
ggplot(country.dat.bcc, aes(x = fromYear, y = data, group = locator, colour = locator)) + 
    geom_point() + geom_path() + ylab("Temperature anomaly over baseline") + 
    theme_bw(base_size = 20)
{% endhighlight %}

![center](/public/img/2013-08-17-sciordata/unnamed-chunk-1.png) 




### Phenology data from the USA National Phenology Network, using rnpn


{% highlight r %}
library(rnpn)

# Lookup names
temp <- lookup_names(name = "bird", type = "common")
comnames <- temp[temp$species_id %in% c(357, 359, 1108), "common_name"]

# Get some data
out <- getobsspbyday(speciesid = c(357, 359, 1108), startdate = "2010-04-01", 
    enddate = "2013-09-31")
names(out) <- comnames
df <- ldply(out)
df$date <- as.Date(df$date)

# Visualize data
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(date, count)) + geom_line() + theme_grey(base_size = 20) + facet_grid(.id ~ 
    .)
{% endhighlight %}

![center](/public/img/2013-08-17-sciordata/rnpn.png) 



### Feedback and new climate data sources

Do use the above pacakges ([govdat][govdat], [rnoaa][rnoaa], [rWBclimate][rWBclimate], and [rnpn][rnpn]) to get climate data, and get in touch with bug reports, and feature requests. 

Surely there are other sources of climate data out there that you want to use in R, right? Let us know what else you want to use. Better yet, if you can sling some R code, start writing your own package to interact with a source of climate data on the web - we can lend a hand.

    After [my presentation yesterday][last] to a group of grad students on R resources, I did a presentation today on intro to R data manipulation, visualizations, and analyses/visualizations of biparite networks and community level analyses (diversity, rarefaction, ordination, etc.). As I said [yesterday][last] I've been playing with two ways to make reproducible presentations in R: [RStudio's presentations][rstudio] built in to RStudio IDE, and [Slidify][slidify]. Yesterday I went with RStudio's product - today I used Slidify. See the Markdown file for the presentation [here](https://github.com/sckott/posterstalks/blob/gh-pages/sfu/resources/r_resources.Rpres). 

Check out the presentation slides [here](https://bitly.com/sfuworkshop), and if you want, fork [the code on Github](http://bit.ly/1bKVX2O), change it, submit changes back to me, etc. (click on the image to go to slides)

How I actually ran the 2 hr workshop was to present a few slides, then live demo writing the code out with students following along, with a number of times where they do something on their own.
