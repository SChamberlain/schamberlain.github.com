I"v<p>I started an R package a while back, and a few people have shown interest, so I thought it was time to revist the code. govdat is an interface to various APIs for government data: currently the Sunlight Labs APIs, and the New York Times congress API. Returned objects from functions are simple lists. In future versions of govdat, I may change how data is returned. The following are examples (which is also the package vignette) of using the Sunlight Labs API. I will add examples of using the New York Times Congress API once their site is up again; Iâ€™m doing this on 2013-08-28, just after the takedown of their site.</p>
