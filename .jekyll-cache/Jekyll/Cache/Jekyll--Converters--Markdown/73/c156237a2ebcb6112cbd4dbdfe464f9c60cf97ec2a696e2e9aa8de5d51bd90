I"l<p>After <a href="http://sckott.github.io/2013/07/r-resources/">my presentation yesterday</a> to a group of grad students on R resources, I did a presentation today on intro to R data manipulation, visualizations, and analyses/visualizations of biparite networks and community level analyses (diversity, rarefaction, ordination, etc.). As I said <a href="http://sckott.github.io/2013/07/r-resources/">yesterday</a> I’ve been playing with two ways to make reproducible presentations in R: <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/presentations/overview">RStudio’s presentations</a> built in to RStudio IDE, and <a href="http://slidify.org/">Slidify</a>. Yesterday I went with RStudio’s product - today I used Slidify. See the Markdown file for the presentation <a href="https://github.com/sckott/posterstalks/blob/gh-pages/sfu/resources/r_resources.Rpres">here</a>.</p>
