I"S<p>It would be nice to easily push each row or column of a data.frame into CouchDB instead of having to prepare them yourself into JSON, then push in to couch. I recently added ability to push data.frameâ€™s into couch using the normal <code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT /{db}</code> method, and added support for the couch bulk API.</p>
