<p>So I heard many people say after or during the recent ESA conference in Portland that they really enjoyed the converstations more than listening to talks or looking at posters.</p>

<p>There was some chatter about doing an unconference associated with next year’s ESA conference in Minneapolis. And Sandra Chung (@sandramchung) got on it and started a wiki that we can all conribute ideas to. The wiki is here: <a href="http://ecologyunconference.wikispaces.com/">http://ecologyunconference.wikispaces.com/</a></p>

<p>What is an unconference? The idea of an unconference is to have a community organized meetup in which interactions among people are emphasized over the traditional lecture and poster format. For example, many sessions may just be organized a single idea, and people attending have a discussion around the topic. The format can be decided by the community.</p>

<p>What will we do there? The broadest restriction is that topics should be about science that happens online. You may say, “Well, real ecology happens in the field!”. Yes, but a lot of the products of ecology are put online, and increasingly the discussion of the practice of ecology happens online. Check out the <a href="http://scienceonline2012.com/">Science Online 2012 website</a> for a little taste of what we hope to achieve next year.</p>

<p>How do I get involved? Go to the wiki and start contributing: <a href="http://ecologyunconference.wikispaces.com/">http://ecologyunconference.wikispaces.com/</a>. There are already some suggestions for topics…Here’s a screenshot of the ideas for Session Proposals page:</p>
