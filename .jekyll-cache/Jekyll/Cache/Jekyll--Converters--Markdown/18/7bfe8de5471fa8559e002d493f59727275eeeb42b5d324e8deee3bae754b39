I"·<p>Many ecologists are R users, but we vary in our understanding of the math and statistical theory behind models we use. There is no clear consensus on what should be the basic mathematical training of ecologists.</p>

<p>To learn what the community thinks, we invite you to fill out a short and anonymous questionnaire on this topic <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mathematicsandecologysurvey/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The questionnaire was designed by <a href="http://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/Fidentite/barraquand/barraquand.htm">Fr√©d√©ric Barraquand</a>, a graduate student at Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie, in collaboration with the International Network of Next-Generation Ecologists (<a href="http://www.innge.net">INNGE</a>).</p>
