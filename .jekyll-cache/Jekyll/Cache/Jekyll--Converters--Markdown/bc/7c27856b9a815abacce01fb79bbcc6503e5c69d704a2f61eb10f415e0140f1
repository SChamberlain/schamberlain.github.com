I"H<p>So, there is a new food web dataset out that was put in Ecological Archives <a href="http://www.esapubs.org/Archive/ecol/E092/173/default.htm">here</a>, and I thought I would play with it.  The food web is from Otago Harbour, an intertidal mudflat ecosystem in New Zealand.  The web contains 180 nodes, with 1,924 links.</p>
