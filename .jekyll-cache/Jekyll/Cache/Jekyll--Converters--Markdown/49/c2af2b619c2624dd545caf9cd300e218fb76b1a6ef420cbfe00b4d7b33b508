I"<p>With all the packages (and beta stage groups of functions) for comparative phylogenetics in R (tested here: picante, geiger, ape, motmot, Liam Revell’s functions), I was simply interested in which functions to use in cases where multiple functions exist to do the same thing. I only show default settings, so perhaps these functions would differ under different parameter settings.  [I am using a Mac 2.4 GHz i5, 4GB RAM]<br /><br />Get motmot here: <a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=782">https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=782</a><br />Get Liam Revell’s functions here: <a href="http://anolis.oeb.harvard.edu/~liam/R-phylogenetics/">http://anolis.oeb.harvard.edu/~liam/R-phylogenetics/</a></p>

<p>It’s hard to pick an overall winner because not all functions are available in all packages, but there are definitely some functions that are faster than others.</p>
