I"/<p>I posted earlier this week about sofa (<a href="http://sckott.github.io/2013/06/couch/">here</a>), introducing a package I started recently that interacts with CouchDB from R. There’s been a fair amount of response at least in terms of page views, so I’ll take that as a sign to keep going.</p>
