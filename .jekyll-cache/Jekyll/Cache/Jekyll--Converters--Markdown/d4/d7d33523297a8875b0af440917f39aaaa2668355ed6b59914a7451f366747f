I"Ý<p>I gave two talks recently at the annual <a href="http://www.crossref.org/annualmeeting/agenda.html">Crossref meeting</a>, one of which was a somewhat technical overview of programmatic clients for Crossref APIs. Check out the talk <a href="https://crossref.wistia.com/medias/8rh0jm5eda">here</a>. I talked about the motivation for working with Crossref data by writing code/etc. rather than going the GUI route, then went over the various clients, with brief examples.</p>
