I"ò<p>Finally, we got <code class="highlighter-rouge">fulltext</code> up on CRAN - our first commit was <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext/commit/2d4f7e270040b2c8914853113073fc4d3134445e">May last year</a>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">fulltext</code> is a package to facilitate text mining. It focuses on open access journals. This package makes it easier to search for articles, download those articles in full text if available, convert pdf format to plain text, and extract text chunks for vizualization/analysis. We are planning to add bits for analysis in future versions. Weâ€™ve been working on this package for a while now. It has a lot of moving parts and package dependencies, so it took a while to get a first useable version.</p>
