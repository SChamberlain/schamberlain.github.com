I"W<p>Excel pivot tables have been how I have reorganized data…up until now. These are just a couple of examples why R is superior to Excel for reorganizing data:</p>

<p>UPDATE: I fixed the code to use ‘dcast’ instead of ‘cast’. And library(ggplot2) instead of library(plyr) [plyr is called along with ggplot2]. Thanks Bob!</p>

<p>Also, see another post on this topic <a href="http://news.mrdwab.com/2010/08/08/using-the-reshape-packagein-r/">here</a>.</p>
