I"}<p>I need to simulate balanced and unbalanced phylogenetic trees for some research I am doing.  In order to do this, I do rejection sampling: simulate a tree -&gt; measure tree shape -&gt; reject if not balanced or unbalanced <strong>enough</strong>.  But what is enough?  We need to define some cutoff value to determine what will be our set of balanced and unbalanced trees.</p>
