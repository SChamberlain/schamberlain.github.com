I"¤<p>A new early online paper in <a href="http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/ajb.1000329v1">American Journal of Botany</a> by <a href="http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/rsargent/">Risa Sargent</a> and colleagues suggests that plants are less sex deprived (pollen limited) in vernal pools that have more closely related plant species. Vernal pools are (at least in my experience) small (to quite large) depressions that fill up with water with winter rains, and dry out completely in the summer. Vernal pool adapted plants flower in rings down the pool as the water dries up. Aquatic invertebrates and some herps can last through the summer by burrowing in the soil.</p>
