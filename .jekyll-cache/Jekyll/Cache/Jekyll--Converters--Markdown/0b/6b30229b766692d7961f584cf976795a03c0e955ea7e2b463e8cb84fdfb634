<p>Back in March this year I wrote <a href="http://recology.info/2016/03/genbank-ids/">a post about a new API for working with GenBank IDs</a>.</p>

<p>I had to take the API down because it was too expensive to keep up. Expensive because the dump of data is very large (3.8 GB compressed), and I need disk space on the server to uncompress that to I think about 18 GB, then load into MySQL, which is another maybe 30 GB or so. Anyway, itâ€™s not expensive because of high traffic - although I wish that was the case - but because of needing lots of disk space.</p>

<p>I was fortuntate to recently receive some <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/">Amazon Cloud Credits for Research</a>. The credits expire in 1 year. With these credits, Iâ€™ve put the GBIDS API back up. In the next year Iâ€™m hoping to gain user traction suggesting thatâ€™s is useful to enough people to keep maintaining - in which case Iâ€™ll seek ways to fund it.</p>

<p>But that means I need people to use it!  So please to give it a try. Let me know what could be better; what could be faster; what API routes/features/etc. youâ€™d like to see.</p>

<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>

<p>Plans for the future of the GBIDS API:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Auto-update the Genbank data. This is quite complicated since the dump is so large. I can either keep an EC2 attached disc large enough to do the dump download/expansion/load/etc, or spin up a new instance each Sunday when they do their data release, do the SQL load, make a dump, then shuttle the SQL dump to the instance running, then load in the new data from the dump. I havenâ€™t got this bit running yet, so data is from Aug 7. 2016.</li>
  <li>Add taxonomic IDs. Genbank also dumps their taxonomic IDs. I think it should be possible to get taxonomic IDs into the API, so that users can do accession number to taxon IDs and vice versa.</li>
  <li>Performance: as anyone would want, I want to continually improve performance. Iâ€™ll watch out for things I can do, but also let me know what seems too slow.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-it">Try it</h2>

<p>Get 5 accession numbers</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl 'https://gbids.xyz/acc?limit=5' | jq .
#&gt; {
#&gt;   "matched": 692006925,
#&gt;   "returned": 5,
#&gt;   "data": [
#&gt;     "A00002",
#&gt;     "A00003",
#&gt;     "X17276",
#&gt;     "X60065",
#&gt;     "CAA42669"
#&gt;   ],
#&gt;   "error": null
#&gt; }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Request to match accession identifiers, some exist, while some do not</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl 'https://gbids.xyz/acc/AACY024124486,AACY024124483,asdfd,asdf,AACY024124476' | jq .
#&gt; {
#&gt;   "matched": 3,
#&gt;   "returned": 5,
#&gt;   "data": {
#&gt;     "AACY024124486": true,
#&gt;     "AACY024124483": true,
#&gt;     "asdfd": false,
#&gt;     "asdf": false,
#&gt;     "AACY024124476": true
#&gt;   },
#&gt;   "error": null
#&gt; }
</code></pre></div></div>
