I"<p>Wikispeedia is a website trying to gather all speed limit signs on Earth.  I recently created a Google Visualization for some of their data, specifically on speed limit signs that change speed throughout the day.  Check it out <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/wikispeedia/browse_thread/thread/c9c712125a597b16">here</a>.  Here is how to see and comment on what they are doing: <a href="http://www.wikispeedia.org/">website</a>, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/wikispeedia?lnk=">Google groups</a>.</p>
