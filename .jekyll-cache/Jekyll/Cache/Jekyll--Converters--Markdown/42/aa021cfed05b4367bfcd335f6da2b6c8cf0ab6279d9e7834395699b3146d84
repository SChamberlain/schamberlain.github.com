I" <p>Here is some code to run Phylometa from R. Phylometa is a program that conducts phylogenetic meta-analyses. The great advantage of the approach below is that you can easily run Phylometa from R, and manipulate the output from Phylometa in R. <br /><br />Phylometa was created by Marc Lajeunesse at University of South Florida, and is described in his 2009 AmNat <a href="http://lajeunesse.myweb.usf.edu/publications.html">paper</a>. Phylometa can be downloaded free <a href="http://lajeunesse.myweb.usf.edu/publications.html">here</a>.</p>
