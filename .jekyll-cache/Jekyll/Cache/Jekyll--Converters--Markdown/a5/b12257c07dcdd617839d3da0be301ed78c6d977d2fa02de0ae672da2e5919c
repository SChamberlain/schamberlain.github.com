I"ù<p>I‚Äôm doing a presentation today to grad students on R resources. I have been writing HTML presentations recently, but some great tools are now available to convert text that is easy to read and write to presentations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>RStudio has something called <code class="highlighter-rouge">R presentations</code>, that is basically Markdown. This tool is built in to RStudio. See some docs <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/presentations/overview">here</a>. A cool feature of RStudio‚Äôs presentations is that the preview of the presentation live updates on each save - nice <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i></li>
  <li>Another option is the slidify package, made by <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv">Ramnath Vaidyanathan</a>. The canonical url for slidify is <a href="http://slidify.org/">here</a>. Slidify gives you more options and flexibity than RStudio presentations.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this presentation I went with RStudio‚Äôs product. See the Markdown file for the presentation <a href="https://github.com/sckott/posterstalks/blob/gh-pages/sfu/resources/r_resources.Rpres">here</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the presentation slides here, and if you want, fork it on Github, change it, submit changes back to me, etc. (click to go to slides)</p>
