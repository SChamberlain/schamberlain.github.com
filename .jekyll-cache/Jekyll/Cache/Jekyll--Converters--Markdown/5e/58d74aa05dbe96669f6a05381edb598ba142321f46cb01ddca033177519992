I"Ì<p>So <a href="http://fna.huh.harvard.edu/">Flora of North America</a> is an awesome collection of taxonomic information for plants across the continent.  However, the information within is not easily machine readable.</p>

<p>So, a little web scraping is called for.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rfna">rfna</a> is an R package to collect information from the Flora of North America.</p>

<p>So far, you can:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get taxonomic names from web pages that index the names.</li>
  <li>Then get daughter URLs for those taxa, which then have their own 2nd order daughter URLs you can scrape, or scrape the 1st order daughter page.</li>
  <li>Query Asteraceae taxa for whether they have paleate or epaleate receptacles.  This function is something I needed, but more functions will be made like this to get specific traits.</li>
</ol>

<p>Further functions will do search, etc.</p>

<p>You can install by:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span class="n">install.packages</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"devtools"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">devtools</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">install_github</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"rfna"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"rOpenSci"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rfna</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here is an example where a set of URLs is acquired using function <code class="highlighter-rouge">getdaughterURLs</code>, then the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">receptacle</code> is used to ask whether of each the taxa at those URLs have paleate or epaleate receptacles.</p>
