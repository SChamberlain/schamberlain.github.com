I"Ï<p>The USGS recently released a way to search for and get species occurrence records for the USA. The service is called <a href="http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/">BISON</a> (Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation). The service has <a href="http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/">a web interface</a> for human interaction in a browser, and <a href="http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/services.html">two APIs</a> (application programming interface) to allow machines to interact with their database. One of the APIs allows you to search and retrieve data, and the other gives back maps as either a heatmap or a species occurrence map. The latter is more appropriate for working in a browser, so Iâ€™ll leave that to the web app folks.</p>
