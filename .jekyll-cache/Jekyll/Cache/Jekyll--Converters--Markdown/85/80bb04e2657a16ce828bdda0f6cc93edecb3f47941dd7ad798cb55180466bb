I"¢<p>After <a href="http://sckott.github.io/2013/07/r-resources/">my presentation yesterday</a> to a group of grad students on R resources, I did a presentation today on intro to R data manipulation, visualizations, and analyses/visualizations of biparite networks and community level analyses (diversity, rarefaction, ordination, etc.). As I said <a href="http://sckott.github.io/2013/07/r-resources/">yesterday</a> Iâ€™ve been playing with two ways to make reproducible presentations in R: <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/presentations/overview">RStudioâ€™s presentations</a> built in to RStudio IDE, and <a href="http://slidify.org/">Slidify</a>. Yesterday I went with RStudioâ€™s product - today I used Slidify. See the Markdown file for the presentation <a href="https://github.com/sckott/posterstalks/blob/gh-pages/sfu/resources/r_resources.Rpres">here</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the presentation slides <a href="https://bitly.com/sfuworkshop">here</a>, and if you want, fork <a href="http://bit.ly/1bKVX2O">the code on Github</a>, change it, submit changes back to me, etc. (click on the image to go to slides)</p>

<p>How I actually ran the 2 hr workshop was to present a few slides, then live demo writing the code out with students following along, with a number of times where they do something on their own.</p>
