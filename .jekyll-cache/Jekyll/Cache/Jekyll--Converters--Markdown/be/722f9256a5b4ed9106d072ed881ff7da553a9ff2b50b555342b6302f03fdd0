I"Ã<p>Recently I had need to create a client for scraping museum metadata to help out some folks that use that kind of data. Itâ€™s called <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/musemeta">musemeta</a>. One of the data sources in that package uses the open source <em>data portal software</em> <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, and so we can interact with <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html">the CKAN API</a> to get data. Since many groups can use CKAN API/etc infrastucture because itâ€™s open source, I thought why not have a general purpose R client for this, since <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/wiki/CKAN-API-Clients">there are other clients</a> for Python, PHP, Ruby, etc.</p>
