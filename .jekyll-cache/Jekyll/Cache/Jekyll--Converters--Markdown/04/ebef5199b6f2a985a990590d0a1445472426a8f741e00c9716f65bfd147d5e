I"¨<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://www.dataone.org/">DataONE</a>? It stands for the Data Observation Network for Earth, and I am involved in the <a href="http://www.dataone.org/working_groups/community-education-and-engagement">Community Education and Engagement working group</a> at DataONE. We try to communicate about data, data management, and similar things to scientists and other DataONE <em>stakeholders</em>.</p>
