I"&<p>We (<a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a>) started a repo to wrap the API for <a href="http://vertnet.org/index.php">VertNet</a>, an open access online database of vertebrate specimen records across many collection holders. Find the open source code <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rvertnet">here</a> - please contribute if you are so inclined.  We had a great Google Summer of Code student, <a href="http://vijaybarve.wordpress.com/">Vijay Barve</a> contributing to the repo this summer, so it is getting close to being CRAN-able.</p>
