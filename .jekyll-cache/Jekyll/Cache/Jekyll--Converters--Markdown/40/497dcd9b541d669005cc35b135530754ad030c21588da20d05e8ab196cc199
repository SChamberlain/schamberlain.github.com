I"3<p>I’ve been working on a Python port of the R package <code class="highlighter-rouge">taxize</code> that I maintain. It’s still early days with this Python library, I’d love to know what people think. For example, I’m giving back Pandas DataFrame’s from most functions. Does this make sense?</p>
