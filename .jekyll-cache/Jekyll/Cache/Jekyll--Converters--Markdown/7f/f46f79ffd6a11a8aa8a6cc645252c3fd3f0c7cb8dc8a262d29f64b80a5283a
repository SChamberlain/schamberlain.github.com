I"H<p>GitHub issues are great for humans to correspond over software, or any other project. At rOpenSci we use an issue based software review system (<a href="https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding">ropensci/onboarding</a>). Software authors and reviewers go back and forth on the software, making a better product in the end.</p>
