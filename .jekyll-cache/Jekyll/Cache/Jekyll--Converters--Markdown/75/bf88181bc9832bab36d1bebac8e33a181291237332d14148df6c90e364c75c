I"è<p>I combined USDA data on farmerâ€™s markets in the US with population census data to get an idea of the disparity in farmers markets by state, and then also expressed per capita.<br /><br />Download USDA data <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5087258&amp;acct=frmrdirmkt">here</a>. The formatted file I used below is <a href="http://schamber.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/farmmarkets.xls">here</a> (in excel format, although I read into R as csv file). The census data is read from url as below.<br /><br />California has a ton of absolute number of farmerâ€™s markets, but Vermont takes the cake by far with number of markets per capita. Iowa comes in a distant second behind Vermont in markets per capita.</p>
