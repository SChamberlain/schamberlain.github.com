<p><small>more details soon on what rooms, etc.</small></p>

<h2 id="agenda">Agenda</h2>

<p>No details yet - but likely to be a series of workshops as well as single track set of talks.</p>

<p>We’ll be accepting talk submissions soonish.</p>

<h2 id="tickets">Tickets</h2>

<p>We aren’t out to make money - tickets will be cheap and probably free for students.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>Why not!?  But srsly, there’s not that many R conferences, so more is better at this point. In addition, there is an increasingly large R community in Portland at least judged by the ~1,140 members in the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/">Portland R Meetup</a> - so a conference makes sense. In addition, this will be an excuse to hopefully get together people from other nearby cities: Corvallis, Salem, Seattle, etc.</p>
