I"ý<p>I recently attended <a href="http://scioclimate.wikispaces.com">ScienceOnline Climate</a>, a conference in Washington, D.C. at AAAS. You may have heard of the <a href="https://twitter.com/#sciox">ScienceOnline annual meeting in North Carolina</a> - this was one of their topical meetings focused on Climate Change. I moderated a session on <a href="http://scioclimate.wikispaces.com/3W.+Working+With+Science+Data+From+Around+The+Web">working with data from the web in R</a>, focusing on climate data. Search Twitter for #scioClimate for tweets from the conference, and #sciordata for tweets from the session I ran. The following is an abbreviated demo of what I did in the workshop showing some of what you can do with climate data in R using our packages.</p>
