<p>Recently I spun up a box on a cloud hosting provider planning to make a tens of thousdands of queries to an Elasticsearch instance on the same box. I could have done this on my own machine, but didn’t want to take up compute resources.</p>

<p>I installed R and Elasticsearch on the box, then went about doing my thang.</p>

<p>A day later when things were still running, the hosting provider sent me a message that apparently my box had been serving up a DDoS attack.</p>

<p>This was incredibly surprising, as I don’t even know how to do such a thing.</p>

<p>After some digging it seems that the culprit was likely Elasticsearch, as a number of tutorials/blog posts state that Elaticsearch is insecure by default, so if it’s exposed on a public port, someone can hack in. I had only used Elasticsearch locally on my own machine, so I hadn’t thought about security. Here’s a few resources for security help:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-elasticsearch-on-an-ubuntu-vps">DigitalOcean tutorial no. 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/elasticsearch-fluentd-and-kibana-open-source-log-search-and-visualization">DigitalOcean tutorial no. 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://saskia-vola.com/install-secure-elasticsearch-1-x-digital-ocean/">Blog post on securing ES</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26006373/how-to-secure-a-digital-ocean-elasticsearch-cluster">SO answer on securing ES</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Trying to narrow down the various pieces of advice for securing Elasticsearch, here’s a list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">iptables</code> (or rather <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nftables">nftables</a>?) to firewall the box</li>
  <li>Whitelist certain trusted IPs</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="https://github.com/Asquera/elasticsearch-http-basic"><code class="highlighter-rouge">elasticsearch-http-basic</code></a> plugin, adds basic username/pwd login</li>
  <li>Remove public access: use <code class="highlighter-rouge">network.bind_host: localhost</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">script.disable_dynamic: true</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">elasticsearch.yml</code> config file <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-elasticsearch-on-an-ubuntu-vps">from</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Elasticsearch provides a new feature for security that’s built into Elasticsearch, <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/shield/">Shield</a>, but I believe it’s only available to enterprise customers. Boo.</p>
