I" <p>Someone asked recently about tips for package development workflow to optimize a successful submission to CRAN.</p>

<p>The ultimate guide is probably <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">Hadleyâ€™s book on package development</a>, but hereâ€™s more of a bulleted list of some things I do.</p>

<h2 id="use-rstudio">Use RStudio</h2>

<p>Choice of text editor/IDE is always contentious, but for R package development, RStudio makes it so easy, including keyboard shortcuts for lots of steps that you need to make development faster. See the <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts">cheatsheet</a>.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-and-roxygen2">Documentation and roxygen2</h2>

<p>You can always write your manual files (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.Rd</code>) files by hand, but to avoid mistakes including missing and duplicate parameter definitions, and other things, simply write documentation alongside your code with <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html">roxygen2</a>. The RStudio IDE includes a keyboard shortcut (shift+cmd+D on Mac) to generate manual files from your roxygen documentation.</p>

<p>When you run either <code class="highlighter-rouge">R CMD CHECK</code> in your terminal or <code class="highlighter-rouge">devtools::check()</code> or simply using keyboard shortcuts in RStudio, you may notice problems with documentation, upon which you can make fixes, quickly re-document the whole package, then run check again. Iterating on this process is very easy with RStudio keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>CRAN checks now actually run code examples wrapped in <code class="highlighter-rouge">\donttest</code>. So if you have examples that may throw warnings or errors on purpose or accident, make sure to wrap them in <code class="highlighter-rouge">\dontrun</code>. Ripley used to complain that at least some examples in the package should run on check, but I havenâ€™t heard this complaint in a while.</p>

<h2 id="first-submission-of-the-package">First submission of the package?</h2>

<p>If it is your first submission of the package:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Include the sentence in your submission <em>I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>CRAN maintainers generally donâ€™t look at code in my experience, but they may in the case of some examples or tests not passing on submission.</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<p>If you have tests in your package, and you should, think about whether your tests are likely to fail in some scenarios. For example, I mostly write packages that work with web APIs, all of which are not under my control, meaning they could fail at any time, causing tests to fail on CRAN (CRAN runs check once per day I think).</p>

<p>If you do have tests may fail, think about ignoring tests all together on CRAN. If you do this, itâ€™s especially important to use continuous integration on your own. For example, use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a>, which will run check on your package on each change. If you have a package that works with web APIs, itâ€™s important to check your package functionality even when you arenâ€™t changing it since the resource your package works with can change. So run tests e.g. once per day - you can <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/travis-restarts">do something like we do using a bit of Ruby code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous integration</h2>

<p>I just talked about this above, but a few more thoughts. This is a relatively easy thing to do, its free, and at least I think it greatly pays off once set up. In addition, you can do more than just test code, and run checks. You can deploy artifacts to various places. That is, for example, you could at the end of a build on Travis-CI, push a binary of the package to Dropbox, or Amazon S3. A few good options that Iâ€™ve used:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> (<a href="https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis">R integration</a>) - Linux/unix builds</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">Appveyor</a> (<a href="https://github.com/krlmlr/r-appveyor">R integration</a>) - Windows builds</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other options, but I havenâ€™t used themâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="description-file">DESCRIPTION file</h2>

<p>In addition to following <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file">CRANâ€™s guidelines</a> (and search <em>description</em> in the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html">CRAN policies</a>), some tips for some of the parts of the file.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Title: must be sentence case, no period at end</li>
  <li>Description: Donâ€™t use the phrase <em>This package</em></li>
  <li>Watch out for <em>possibly mis-spelled words</em> warnings on check. They will reject your package for very minor mis-spellings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-cran-commentsmd-file">Use cran-comments.md file</h2>

<p>Hadley supports this in <code class="highlighter-rouge">devtools</code>. Put a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">cran-comments.md</code> in the root of your package. In this file, include the comments you would submit for the package (e.g., I agree to cran policiesâ€¦this package passed all checksâ€¦etc). Rembmer to put <code class="highlighter-rouge">cran-comments.md</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.Rbuildignore</code> file in the root of your package so that <code class="highlighter-rouge">R CMD CHECK</code> doesnâ€™t complain. When you use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">devtools::release()</code> function, it will look for this file, and automatically throw in your submission comments. Doing this and using <code class="highlighter-rouge">release()</code> means you donâ€™t have to worry about Brian Ripley complaining about rich text emails.</p>

<h2 id="cran-policy-changes">CRAN policy changes</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re on Twitter, watch the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#rstats</code> hashtag to be more likely to notice any upcoming changes in package submission policies. Also can follow Dirkâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/eddelbuettel/crp">CRAN policy watch repo</a>.</p>
