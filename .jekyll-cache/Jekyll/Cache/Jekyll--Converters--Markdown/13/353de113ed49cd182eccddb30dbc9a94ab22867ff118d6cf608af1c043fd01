I"ç<p>I was returning to a long-term project I‚Äôve been working on - a package for caching HTTP requests in R called <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/vcr">vcr</a>, a port of the Ruby gem <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr">vcr</a> - when you do that thing you do when you are porting a library from one language to another. I stumbled upon some methods/functions I wasn‚Äôt familiar with.</p>
