I"S<p>Described in a new Methods in Ecology and Evolution paper <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00180.x/abstract">here</a>, a new <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNetLogo/index.html">RNetLogo</a> allows you to use <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> from R.</p>

<p>NetLogo is software is a “multi-agent programmable modeling environment”. NetLogo can be used in individual- and agent-based modeling, and is used in the book <a href="http://www.railsback-grimm-abm-book.com/"><em>Agent-based and Individual-based Modeling: A Practical Introduction</em></a> by Railsback &amp; Grimm.</p>

<p>I have not tried the package yet, but looks interesting. I am always a fan of running stand-alone programs from R if possible.</p>
