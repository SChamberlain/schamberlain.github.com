I"<p>GitHub has this site <a href="https://gist.github.com/">https://gist.github.com/</a> in which we can share code, text, images, maps, plots, etc super easily, without having to open up a repo, etc. GitHub gists are a great way to throw up an example use case to show someone, or show code that’s throwing errors to a support person, etc. In addition, there’s API access, which means we can interact with Gists not just from their web interface, but from the command line, or any programming language. There are clients for <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/gistup">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/gist">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gists/0.4.6">Python</a>, and on and on. But AFAIK there wasn’t one for R. Along with <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv">Ramnath</a> and others, we’ve been working on an R client for gists. <code class="highlighter-rouge">v0.1</code> is <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gistr/index.html">now on CRAN</a>. Below is an overview.</p>
