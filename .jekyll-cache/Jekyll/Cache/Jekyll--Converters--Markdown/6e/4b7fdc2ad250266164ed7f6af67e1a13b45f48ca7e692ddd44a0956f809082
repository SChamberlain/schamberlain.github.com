I"<p>I’ve been working on a little thing called <code class="highlighter-rouge">httping</code> - a small R package that started as a pkg to Ping urls and time requests. It’s a port of the Ruby gem <a href="https://github.com/jpignata/httping">httping</a>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">httr</code> package is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Depends</code> in this package, so its functions can be called directly, without having to load <code class="highlighter-rouge">httr</code> explicitly yourself.</p>
