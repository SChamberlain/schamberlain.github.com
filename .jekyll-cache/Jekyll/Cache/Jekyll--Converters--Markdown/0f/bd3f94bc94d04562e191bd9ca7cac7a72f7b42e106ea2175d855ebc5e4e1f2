I"í<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/solr/issues/47">help of user input</a>, Iâ€™ve tweaked <code class="highlighter-rouge">solr</code> just a bit to make things faster using default setings. I imagine the main interface for people using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">solr</code> R client is via <code class="highlighter-rouge">solr_search()</code>, which used to have <code class="highlighter-rouge">wt=json</code> by default. Changing this to <code class="highlighter-rouge">wt=csv</code> gives better performance. And it sorta makes sense to use csv, as the point of using an R client is probably do get data eventually into a data.frame, so it makes sense to go csv format (Already in tabular format) if itâ€™s faster too.</p>
