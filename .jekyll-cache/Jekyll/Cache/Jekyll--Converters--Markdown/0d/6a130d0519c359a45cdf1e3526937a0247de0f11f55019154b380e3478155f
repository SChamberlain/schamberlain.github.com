I"‚<p>If you maintain an R package, or even use R packages, you may have looked at CRAN check results. These are essentially the results of running <code class="highlighter-rouge">R CMD CHECK</code> on a package. They do these for each package for each of a few different operating systems (debian, fedora, solaris, windows, osx) and different R versions (devel, release and patched).</p>
