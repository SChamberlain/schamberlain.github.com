I"Ž<p>UPDATE: See Carl Boettigerâ€™s functions/package at Github for searching Treebase <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/treeBASE">here</a>.</p>

<p>Treebase is a great resource for phylogenetic trees, and has a nice interface for searching for certain types of trees. However, if you want to simply download a lot of trees for analyses (like that in <a href="http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/davies/pdfs/Davies_etal_Evolution_2011.pdf">Davies et al.</a>), then you want to be able to access trees in bulk (I believe Treebase folks are working on an API though). I wrote some simple code for extracting trees from <a href="http://treebase.org/">Treebase.org</a>.<br /><br />It reads an xml file of (in this case consensus) URLâ€™s for each tree, parses the xml, makes a vector of URLâ€™s, reads the nexus files with error checking, remove trees that gave errors, then a simple plot looking at metrics of the trees.</p>

<p>Is there an easier way to do this?</p>
