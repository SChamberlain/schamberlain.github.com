I"ö<p>Recology used to be hosted on Blogger, and my personal website was hosted on Wordpress.  Neither platform was very satisfying.  Blogger is very limited in their layouts, unless you use dynamic views, which suck because they donâ€™t allow javascript snippets to render GitHub gists.  Wordpress is just limited all around as you canâ€™t put in hardly anythig excep text and some pictures. They both have their place, but not so much for content that requires syntax highlighting, references, etc.</p>
