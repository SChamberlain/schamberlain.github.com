I"ª<p>I did a little simulation to examine how K and lambda vary in response to tree size (and how they compare to each other on the same simulated trees). I use Liam Revellâ€™s functions fastBM to generate traits, and phylosig to measure phylogenetic signal.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Two observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, it seems that lambda is more sensitive than K to tree size, but then lambda levels out at about 40 species, whereas K continues to vary around a mean of 1.</li>
  <li>Second, K is more variable than lambda at all levels of tree size (compare standard error bars).</li>
</ul>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Does this make sense to those smart folks out there?
