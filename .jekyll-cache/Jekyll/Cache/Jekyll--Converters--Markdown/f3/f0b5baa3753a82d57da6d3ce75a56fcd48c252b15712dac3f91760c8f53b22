I"o<p>There are a lot of ways to make R packages. Many blog posts have covered making

packages, going from the required files for a package, what to put in DESCRIPTION, etc. But what about the tooling? I’m not going to talk about the code, etc. - but rather the different ways to approach it.</p>
