I"z<p>So my advisor pointed out this ‘new’ (well, 2004), way of plotting results of logistic regression results.  The idea was presented in a 2004 Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America issue (<a href="http://esapubs.org/bulletin/backissues/085-3/bulletinjuly2004_2column.htm#tools1">here</a>).  I tried to come up with a  solution using, what else, ggplot2.  I don’t have it quite all the way down - I am missing the second y-axis values for the histograms, but someone smarter than me can figure that part out (note that Hadley doesn’t want to support second y-axes in ggplot2, but they can probably be hacked on).</p>
