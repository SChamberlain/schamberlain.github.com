I"•<p>UPDATE: code and figure updated at 647 AM CST on 19 Dec â€˜11. Also, see Jarrett Byrnes (improved) fork of my gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/1474802">here</a>.</p>

<p>The site <a href="http://iworkfortheinternet.org/">I WORK FOR THE INTERNET</a> is collecting pictures and first names (last name initials only) to show collective support against SOPA (the Stop Online Piracy Act). Please stop by their site and add your name/picture.</p>

<p>I used the #rstats package twitteR, created by Jeff Gentry, to search for tweets from people signing this site with their picture, then plotted using ggplot2, and also used Hadleyâ€™s lubridate to round timestamps on tweets to be able to bin tweets in to time slots for plotting.</p>

<p>Tweets containing the phrase â€˜I work for the internetâ€™ by time:</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the code as a GitHub gist. Sometimes the searchTwitter fxn doesnâ€™t returns an error, which I donâ€™t understand, but you can play with it:</p>
