I"q<p>I maintain an R client for the GBIF API, at <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif">rgbif</a>. Been working on it for a few years, and recently been thinking that there should be a nice low level client for Python as well. I didnâ€™t see one searching Github, etc. so I started working on one recently: <a href="https://github.com/sckott/pygbif">pygbif</a></p>
