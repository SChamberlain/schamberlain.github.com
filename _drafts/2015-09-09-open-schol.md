[Geoff Bilder][geoff], [Jennifer Lin][jlin], and [Cameron Neylon][cam] wrote a great [post][post] back in February this year titled _Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructures_. 

## The principles

They discussed three principles (with short synopses to describe each):

* Governance

> If an infrastructure is successful and becomes critical to the community, we need to ensure it is not co-opted by particular interest groups.

* Sustainability

> An organisation that is both well meaning and has the right expertise will still not be trusted if it does not have sustainable resources to execute its mission.

* Insurance

> Long term trust requires the community to believe it retains control.

Within each of the three principles are a set of guidelines to follow. 

## What about software?

Towards the end of the post, they ask:

> What would an organisation actually look like if run on these principles?

They list [ORCID][orcid] and [CERN][cern] as examples. They didn't mention software per se, but I think software can be thought of as infrastructure. I think [rOpenSci][ros] is an example of software infrastructure. Let me explain.

Are we really infrastructure? I think we are in a sense. We are building a long-lasting framework for building and maintaining software, supporting the people that make the software, and maintaing the underlying tools to make it all run smoothly. 

The breadth of our work is increasing. We started making software clients to work with data in ecology and evolutionary biology. Since then, we've branched out to many disciplines, and many types of tools. 

Our community...

We provide a number of services that are infrastructury:

* Code review
* Community standards for quality software
* General purpose software that solves all reasonable use cases
* Liberally licensed software that can be used in all settings
* Low level clients for many data science tools

In some ways, rOpenSci isn't infrastructure. For example, we are specific to a single programming language. However, this could change in time, and anyway, R is one language, but used across all sectors and in all disciplines.
