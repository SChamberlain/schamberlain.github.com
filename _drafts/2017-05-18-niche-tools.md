In a [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc6qnwbJbTU) by [Noam Ross](http://www.noamross.net/) he showed a plot of downloads of R packages from CRAN, pointing out the long tail of packages that are for one reason or another not downloaded very much - and therefore not used by many people.

One may want to ignore these small tools because they aren't widely used, but they aren't widely used precisely because they are for a niche use case. 

In fact, it's great to see small, niche software for a very specific use case, especially if it gets used widely within the reasonable set of people that could use it.  I know I did, and many others have as well, duplicated work for reading in a certain kind of file, manipulating it, etc. - we want to reduce this duplicated code and effort whenever possible. When a piece of software comes along to solve that specific use case, ideally everyone uses that, and we have a lot less duplicated code. 

An interesting problem with smaller, niche software is that people that make software full or part time may not have the interest to work on these more niche tools.  Or, perhaps because of the niche nature of it, software folks won't even think to make the tool.  

This is where the people that need software for niche use cases hopefully step in: they know the problem; they know the caveats to be aware of; and importantly, they know people that would likely want to use the software. One issue that may arise with domain people making software is less software knowledge. 

So let's encourage niche software tools - not every package needs to be used by everyone on the planet.
