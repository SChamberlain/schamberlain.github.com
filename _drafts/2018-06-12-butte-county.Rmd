# Why Butte County?

I went to college at California State University, Chico - in Butte County, CA. I did a BA degree in Biology there. It was a great program as it was heavily focused on natural history - with classes on herps, birds, insects, fish, etc. 

# Specimen collections data

Specimen collections data are increasingly being digitized, and often accessed via largeish platforms like GBIF and iDigBio. Here I'll explore Butte County data found with iDigBio with the [spocc][] R package. You could also use the [ridigbio][] package to go directly to iDigBio data. 

# Get some data

Get county GeoJSON data using [jqr][]

```{r}
library(jqr)
butte <- jq(url("http://eric.clst.org/assets/wiki/uploads/Stuff/gz_2010_us_050_00_5m.json"), '.features[] | select(.properties.NAME == "Butte" and .properties.STATE == "06")')
mean_lon <- mean(as.numeric(jq(butte, ".geometry.coordinates[][] | first")))
mean_lat <- mean(as.numeric(jq(butte, ".geometry.coordinates[][] | last")))
```

Install [spocc][]

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("spocc")) install.packages("spocc")
library(spocc)
```

Search for data in Butte County. First lets get a look at how many records there are:

```{r}
opts <- list(rq = list(
  stateprovince = "California",
  county = "Butte",
  geopoint = list(type = "exists")
))
res <- occ(from = "idigbio", idigbioopts = opts, limit = 1)
res$idigbio$meta$found
```

Looks like `r res$idigbio$meta$found` records found. Now let's get all those records

```{r cache = TRUE}
res <- occ(from = "idigbio", idigbioopts = opts, limit = 46000L)
```

Make a map!

```{r eval=FALSE}
res$idigbio$data$custom_query$name <- res$idigbio$data$custom_query$name[1]
library(mapr)
mapr::map_leaflet(res) %>% 
  leaflet::addGeoJSON(butte) %>% 
  leaflet::setView(mean_lon, mean_lat, 10)
```

> note: there's definitely points that fall outside of Butte County, but we'll ignore those for simplicity sake

What's the taxonomic breakdown like?  

```{r}
library(dplyr)
df <- res$idigbio$data$custom_query
(x <- df %>% 
    group_by(class) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n)))
```

Looks like the vast, vast majority are plants, and more specifically Magnoliopsida (56%). About 3% are insects; about 0.6% birds; 0.1% reptiles; and 0.11% mammals. 

First, get Butte County data in a sp class

```{r}
library(sp)
library(ggplot2)

county <- map_data("county")
butte_co <- filter(county, region == "california", subregion == "butte")
butte_poly <- SpatialPolygons(list(Polygons(list(Polygon(butte_co[, c(1,2)])), ID=1)))
```

Insects:

```{r}
library(tmap)
insects <- df %>% dplyr::filter(class == "insecta")
coordinates(insects) <- c('longitude', 'latitude')
tm_shape(butte_poly) + 
  tm_borders() + 
  tm_shape(insects) + 
  tm_symbols(col = "black", border.col = "white", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
````

Birds:

```{r}
birds <- df %>% dplyr::filter(class == "aves")
coordinates(birds) <- c('longitude', 'latitude')
tm_shape(butte_poly) + 
  tm_borders() + 
  tm_shape(birds) + 
  tm_symbols(col = "black", border.col = "white", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
````

Facet by taxonomic group

```{r}
library(sp)
library(rgeos)
library(ggplot2)
library(tmap)

# get subset of data for particular classes
# this is a very large portion of the data
df_class_subset <- df %>% filter(class %in% c("magnoliopsida", "liliopsida", NA, 
  "insecta", "pinopsida", "aves", "amphibia", "mammalia", "reptilia"))
coordinates(df_class_subset) <- c('longitude', 'latitude')

# get butte county data into a polygon
county <- map_data("county")
butte_co <- filter(county, region == "california", subregion == "butte")
butte_poly <- SpatialPolygons(list(Polygons(list(Polygon(butte_co[, c(1,2)])), ID=1)))

# clip data to butte county
df_class_subset_clipped <- raster::intersect(df_class_subset, butte_poly)

tm_shape(butte_poly) + 
  tm_borders() + 
  tm_shape(df_class_subset_clipped) + 
  tm_symbols(col = "black", border.col = "white", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_facets(by = "class", nrow = 3, free.coords = FALSE)
```

Collectors. Lowell Ahart is kind of a legend in Butte County, collecting plants like crazy. Let's see how many records he has

```{r}
df %>% filter(grepl("ahart", collector, ignore.case = TRUE))
```

Wow. That's a big portion of the total records in the county.
