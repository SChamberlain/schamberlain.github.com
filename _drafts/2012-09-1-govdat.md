I created an R package a while back to interact with some APIs that serve up data on what our elected represenatives are up to, including the [New York Times Congress API](http://developer.nytimes.com/), and the [Sunlight Labs API](http://services.sunlightlabs.com/).

What kinds of things can you do with `govdat`?  Here are a few examples.

### How do the two major parties differ in the use of certain words (searches the congressional record using the Sunlight Labs Capitol Words API)?

```r
# install_github('govdat', 'schamberlain')
library(govdat)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)

dems <- sll_cw_dates(phrase = "science", start_date = "1996-01-20", end_date = "2012-09-01", 
    granularity = "year", party = "D", printdf = TRUE)
repubs <- sll_cw_dates(phrase = "science", start_date = "1996-01-20", end_date = "2012-09-01", 
    granularity = "year", party = "R", printdf = TRUE)
df <- melt(rbind(data.frame(party = rep("D", nrow(dems)), dems), data.frame(party = rep("R", 
    nrow(repubs)), repubs)))
df$count <- as.numeric(df$count)

ggplot(df, aes(yearmonth, count, colour = party, group = party)) + geom_line() + 
    labs(y = "use of the word 'Science'") + theme_bw(base_size = 18) + opts(axis.text.x = theme_text(size = 10), 
    panel.grid.major = theme_blank(), panel.grid.minor = theme_blank(), legend.position = c(0.2, 
        0.8))
```

## It looks like a lot of individual donations (the count facet) by finance/insurance/realestate, but by amount, the most (by slim margin) is from labor organizations.

### Or we may want to get a bio of a congressperson. Here we get Jeanne Shaheen of NH. And some twitter searching too? Indeed.

```r
out <- nyt_cg_memberbioroles("A000358")  # cool, lots of info, output cutoff for brevity
out[[3]][[1]][1:2]
```

```
$member_id
[1] "A000358"

$first_name
[1] "Todd"

```

```r

# we can get her twitter id from this bio, and search twitter using
# twitteR package
akintwitter <- out[[3]][[1]]$twitter_id

# install.packages('twitteR')
library(twitteR)
tweets <- userTimeline(akintwitter, n = 100)
tweets[1:5]  # there's some gems in there no doubt
```
