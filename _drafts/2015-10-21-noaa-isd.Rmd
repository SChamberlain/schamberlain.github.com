I've recently made some improvements to the functions that work with ISD 
(Integrated Surface Database) data.

__isd data__

* The `isd()` function now caches more intelligently. We now cache using 
`.rds` files via `saveRDS`/`readRDS`, whereas we used to use `.csv` files, 
which take up much more disk space, and we have to worry about not changing 
data formats on reading data back into an R session. This has the downside
that you can't just go directly to open up a cached file in your favorite 
spreadsheet viewer, but you can do that manually after reading in to R. 
* In addition, `isd()` now has a function `cleanup`, if `TRUE` after 
downloading the data file from NOAA's ftp server and processing, we delete 
the file. That's fine since we have the cached processed file. But you 
can choose not to cleanup the original data files.
* Data processing in `isd()` is improved as well. We convert key variables
to appropriate classes to be more useful. 

__isd stations__

* In `isd_stations()`, there's now a cached version of the station data in 
the package, or you can get optionally get fresh station data from NOAA's 
FTP server.
* There's a new function `isd_stations_search()` that uses the station data
to allow you to search for stations via either:
  * A bounding box
  * Radius froma point

## Install

For examples below, you'll need the development version:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnoaa")
```

Load `rnoaa`

```{r}
library("rnoaa")
```

## ISD stations 

### Get stations

There's a cached version of the station data in the package, or you can get fresh
station data from NOAA's FTP server.

```{r}
stations <- isd_stations()
head(stations)
```

### Filter and visualize stations

In addition to getting the entire station data.frame, you can also search for stations,
either with a bounding box or within a radius from a point. First, the bounding box

```{r}
bbox <- c(-125.0, 38.4, -121.8, 40.9)
out <- isd_stations_search(bbox = bbox)
head(out)
```

Where is the bounding box? (you'll need [lawn](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/lawn/), or you can vizualize some other way)

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("lawn")
lawn::lawn_bbox_polygon(bbox) %>% view
```

![plot1](/public/img/2015-10-21-noaa-isd/bbox_area.png)

Vizualize station subset - yep, looks right

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("leaflet")
leaflet(data = out) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles()
```

![plot1](/public/img/2015-10-21-noaa-isd/bbox_result.png)

Next, search with a lat/lon coordinate, with a radius. That is, we search for stations
within X km from the coordinate.

```{r}
out <- isd_stations_search(lat = 38.4, lon = -123, radius = 250)
head(out)
```

Again, compare search area to stations found

_search area_

```{r eval=FALSE}
pt <- lawn::lawn_point(c(-123, 38.4))
lawn::lawn_buffer(pt, dist = 250) %>% view
```

![plot1](/public/img/2015-10-21-noaa-isd/circle_radius)

_stations found_

```{r eval=FALSE}
leaflet(data = out) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles()
```

## ISD data

### Get ISD data

Here, I get data for four stations.

```{r}
res1 <- isd(usaf="011690", wban="99999", year=1993)
res2 <- isd(usaf="172007", wban="99999", year=2015)
res3 <- isd(usaf="702700", wban="00489", year=2015)
res4 <- isd(usaf="109711", wban=99999, year=1970)
```

Then, combine data, with `rnoaa:::rbind.isd()`

```{r}
res_all <- rbind(res1, res2, res3, res4)
```

Add date time

```{r}
library("lubridate")
res_all$date_time <- ymd_hm(
  sprintf("%s %s", as.character(res_all$date), res_all$time)
)
```

Remove 999's (NOAA's way to indicate missing/no data)

```{r}
library("dplyr")
res_all <- res_all %>% filter(temperature < 900)
```

### Visualize ISD data

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(res_all, aes(date_time, temperature)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~usaf_station, scales = "free_x")
```
