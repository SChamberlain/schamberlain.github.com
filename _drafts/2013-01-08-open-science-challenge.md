Science is becoming more open in many areas: publishing, data sharing, lab notebooks, and software. There are many benefits to open science. For example, sharing research data alongside your publications leads to increased citation rate (Piwowar _et. al._ 2007). In addition, X. How can we speed up adoption of open science?

***************

To speed up adoption of open science approaches, we ([ropensci](http://ropensci.org/)) have just kicked off the [rOpenSci Open Science Challenge](http://ropensci.org/open-science-challenge/). If you aren't familiar with rOpenSci, it is a developer collective connecting scientists to open science data on the web. Since R is the most popular programming language for life scientists, it made sense to do this in R (instead of Python e.g.). 

***************

What is the challenge about? We want to facilitate open science. Since we write software, this challenge asks you to propose a project using one or more of our packages - or perhaps you want to propose a new dataset to connect to R. The rOpenSci core developer team will help you with any problems using our packages, and attempt to modify packages according to feedback from participants. Do you use one or more of our R packages? If you do, great. If not, check out our packages [here](http://ropensci.org/packages/index.html).

__How to apply?__ Just send an email to [info@ropensci.org](mailto:info@ropensci.org?subject=rOpenSci Open Science Challenge). 

__The deadline to apply is Jan. 31, 2013.__
