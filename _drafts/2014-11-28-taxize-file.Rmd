A missed chat on the rOpenSci website asked:

> Hi there, i am trying to use the taxize package and have a .csv file of species names to run through taxize updating them. What would be the code i would need to run to achieve this?

This esentially boils down to (I think) how do I start? Without knowing specifically what this person wants to do, and I can't ask them as I don't know their conctact info, what would you do if you'd never used `taxize` before, and you sort of wanted to know where to start.
