Earlier, I posted about <a href="http://r-ecology.blogspot.com/2011/01/ecological-networks-from-abundance.html">generating networks from abundance distributions that you specify</a>. If this post was interesting, check out Jeff Kilpatrick's website, where he provides code he produced in R and Octave to compare real bipartite networks to ones generated based on ecological variables measured in the field (in our case it was abundance, bod<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">y size, and nectar production). We used that code for a <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1055615l6m74mp30/">paper we published</a>. Code was modified from code produced by <a href="http://www.cricyt.edu.ar/interactio/dvazquez/html/index_e.html">Diego P. Vazquez</a>.&nbsp;</span>
