This blog has lasted a whole year already. &nbsp;Thanks for reading and commenting. 

### There are a couple of announcements:

1. Less blogging: I hope to put in many more years blogging here, but in full disclosure [I am blogging for Journal of Ecology][jeco] now, so I am going to be (and already have been) blogging less here.
2. More blogging: If anyone wants to write guest posts at Recology on the topics of using R for ecology and evolution, or open science, please contact me. 
3. Different blogging: I was going to roll out the new dynamic views for this blog, but Google doesn't allow javascript, which is how I include code using GitHub gists. Oh well...

Anywho, here is the breakdown of visits to this blog, visualized using #ggplot2, of course. There were a total of about 23,000 pageviews in the first year of this blog.
