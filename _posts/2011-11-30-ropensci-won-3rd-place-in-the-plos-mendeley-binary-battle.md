I am part of the rOpenSci development team (<a href="http://ropensci.org/developers/" target="_blank">along with Carl Boettiger, Karthik Ram, and Nick Fabina</a>).

Our website: <a href="http://ropensci.org/">http://ropensci.org/</a>.
Code at Github:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ropensci">https://github.com/ropensci</a>

We entered two of our R packages for integrating with PLoS Journals (rplos) and Mendeley (RMendeley) in the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://dev.mendeley.com/api-binary-battle" href="http://dev.mendeley.com/api-binary-battle" target="_blank">Mendeley-PLoS Binary Battle</a>.

Get them at GitHub (<a data-mce-href="https://github.com/ropensci/rplos" href="https://github.com/ropensci/rplos" target="_blank">rplos</a>;&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://github.com/ropensci/RMendeley" href="https://github.com/ropensci/RMendeley" target="_blank">RMendeley</a>).

These two packages allow users (from R! of course) to search and retrieve data from PLoS journals (including their altmetrics data), and from Mendeley. &nbsp;You could surely mash up data from both PLoS and Mendeley. &nbsp;That's what's cool about rOpenSci - we provide the tools, and leave it up to users vast creativity to do awesome things.

3rd place gives us a $1,000 prize, plus a&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/uk/" href="http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/uk/" target="_blank">Parrot AR Drone helicopter</a>.
