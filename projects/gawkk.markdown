Gawkk automatically aggregates and categorizes video from thousands of 
websites. Channels of videos can be subscribed to and videos liked by 
and commented on by your friends will show up in your news feed. This 
site was sold in early 2010.

I was contracted to build Gawkk and was responsible for all technical 
decisions. I was the sole developer before it was sold.
