PGnJ is a database development environment for Mac OS X. Unlike clients that 
came before it, PGnJâ€™s unique, single window interface gives you everything 
you need, right at your fingertips.

Development for this project started in 2004 and continued for nearly four 
years. Version 1.0 was released in December of 2008 and a few minor 
improvements were released in 2009.

### Features

* Support for major databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and SQLite.
* Query Editor with syntax highlighting, error suggestion and sql templates.
* Table Data Editor that supports out of the box pagination and custom sql 
	where and order by clauses.
* One of a kind QuickJoin feature that lets you simply join columns in from 
	associated tables while browsing your data in the Table Data Editor. It's 
	pretty great.
* Fully keyboard navigable interface. Jump between views, execute queries, 
	load scripts, navigate database objects and inspect column details all from 
	the comfort of your keyboard.
* Store sql scripts in the Script Library for future use. Scripts even support 
	:variables that can be set before execution.
* Executed queries are stored in the history browser. See them all at once or 
	step through one by one right from the Query Editor.
* A powerful one window interface, flexible data exports and many more features.

### Important Support Related Notes

* PGnJ 1.2 Preview works better on Snow Leopard.
* Because of Java's continually diminishing support, future versions of OS X 
	may or may not be supported.
* I highly recommend [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) for MySQL users, 
	which has embraced the single window design seen in PGnJ since early 2004.
