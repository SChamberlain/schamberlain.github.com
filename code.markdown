rOpenSci - Tools to facilitate open science in the R environment.

* [rplos is now up on CRAN][rplos]

See my GITHUB page ([here][]) for code repositories and code snippets in the gists ([here2][]).

* Code for simulating mutualistic networks. Link to Jeff Kilpatrick’s website [here3][].
* Meta-analysis database (used in Chamberlain & Holland 2009 Ecology). Download the database by going to [Ecological Archives][].
* Code for running Phylometa in R. Download the two files needed: [phylometa_fxn.R][] and [phylometa_inR_run.R][]. See [my blog][myblog2] for an explanation and example of this code. Get Phylometa at [Marc's website][marc].
* Code for running Phylometa in R, but only comparing observed phylogenetic MA to a shuffle tip traditional MA: [phylogmeta_rand_fxn_one.R][]. [Tree file][]. " [Data file][]. See [my blog post][] about usage.
* Code for adjusting branch lengths: [bladjing_twomethods.R][code], example of use at [my blog][], [tree file][], and [node ages file][node].
* [State abbreviations and full names][state]
* [USDA farmers markets][farm]: (excel format, can't upload csv files)
