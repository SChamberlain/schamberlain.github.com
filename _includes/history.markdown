### A Brief History

In 2011, I dropped all client work to pursue my own services full time.

In 2007, I left my job writing JEE applications and began taking contract 
work, mostly writing web applications with Ruby on Rails.

In 2002, I started work full time at an aerospace company writing Java 
Enterprise software and attending [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu) 
as a Computer Science major.
