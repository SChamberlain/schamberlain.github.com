Hi, I'm Tom, a software engineer and entrepreneur living on Long Island. I own
and operate a number of services, including an [online store platform](http://limitedpressing.com)
and a [community marketplace](http://theoldlp.com).

Although the majority of my work isn't open source, I do have a few projects on
[GitHub](http://github.com/tsmango).

Aside from writing software, I enjoy spending time with my bulldog,
[Napoleon](/napoleon), eating sandwiches and listening to hardcore and punk music.

You can find me occasionally writing things [here](/articles) and tweeting on
[@tsmango](http://twitter.com/tsmango).
